# PirateRoulette

## Description
PirateRoulette is a Unity game that brings the suspense of Russian Roulette to the high seas. The loser is decided by inserting a sword into a pirate-themed cylinder. This is my first Unity project, and was submitted as an assignment for the Game Design and Planning class at Soongsil University.

## Installation
Clone this repository and open in Unity version 2021.3.22f1 or higher.

## Usage
The game is controlled using the keyboard and mouse:
* A/D: Move the camera.
* Mouse Click: Insert a sword into the cylinder.

If the pirate's head falls out of the cylinder when a sword is inserted, that player is declared the winner. As a twist on the classic game, players can choose to insert as many swords as they wish during their turn, adding an element of strategy and risk.
